If you want to play Counter-Strike Doom 2 Crack offline, you can either play solo or with bots. To add bots, open the console and type "addbot" followed by the number of bots you want. For example, "addbot 4" will add four bots to your team. You can also customize the bot skill level, team, name, and skin by using different commands. For a full list of commands, check out the csdmo.txt file in the mod folder.
 
If you want to play Counter-Strike Doom 2 Crack online, you will need to join a server that hosts the mod. You can either use the in-game browser or connect directly using the console. To use the in-game browser, go to multiplayer > join game > internet > refresh list. To connect directly using the console, type "connect" followed by the server IP address. For example, "connect csdmo.oof.lv" will connect you to a competitive server hosted by rcon420.
 
You can also host your own server using GZDoom or Zandronum. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder for your server and copy the base mod file and the optional files to it.
2. Create a server configuration file (server.cfg) and edit it according to your preferences. You can use the sample server.cfg file in the mod folder as a reference.
3. Run gzdoom.exe or zandronum.exe with the -host parameter and specify the number of players. For example, "gzdoom.exe -host 8" will host a server for up to eight players.
4. Share your server IP address with your friends or other players who want to join.
